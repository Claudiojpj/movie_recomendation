## Learn

Scikit Learn - KNeighborsClassifier

-> The K in the name of this classifier represents the k nearest neighbors, where k is an integer value specified by the user. Hence as the name suggests, this classifier implements learning based on the k nearest neighbors. The choice of the value of k is dependent on data.

-> Brute force algorithm : After arranging the K neighbours based on mode, brute-force ended up picking the first class instead of picking the class which had least distance in the distance metric. This affects the accuracy for the brute-force algorithm when k value is even.
